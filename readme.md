# Quartic.js [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis] [![devDependency Status][david-image]][david]

> JavaScript library for solving quartic equations.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install quartic
```

### Usage

Pass an array of the 5 coefficients of equation to solve, from the `x^4` term down to the constant term.

The results are returned as [Math.js][mathjs] complex number objects, with `re` and `im` properties that hold the real and imaginary part of the complex root respectively.

```js
var quartic = require('quartic');

//Solve 5x^4 + 4x^3+ 3x^2 + 2x + 1
var roots = quartic(5,4,3,2,1); 

console.log(roots);
```

## Get the code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lavelle/quartic
$ cd quartic
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
